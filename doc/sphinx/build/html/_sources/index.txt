MDpow documentation
===================

*MDpow* is a python package that automates the calculation of
solvation free energies via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In
particular, it facilitates the computation of *water-octanol partition
coefficients* (|Pow|).

The package is built on top of the `GromacsWrapper`_ framework (which
can be automatically installed).
