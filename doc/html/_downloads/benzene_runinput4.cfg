## define variable names that can be used in all the other

## directory

## Then in any other section you can refer to workdir as %(topdir)s,

## MDPOW does not define any DEFAULT variables.


[setup]
## setup of the equilibrium simulation, including solvation and energy
## minimisation

name = benzene
# common name (avoid spaces and special characters as this is used to
# construct file and directory names and legends in plots)

molecule = BNZ
# compound identifier; must match the [ molecule ] identifier in the
# itp file

itp = benzene/benzene.itp
# Gromacs itp topology file for the compound using the OPLS/AA force
# field. Path is relative to the directory in which mdpow-equilibrium
# is invoked.

structure = benzene/benzene.pdb
# coordinate file (any file format that Gromacs can read). Path is
# relative to the directory in which mdpow-equilibrium is invoked.

maxwarn = 0
# maximum number of warnings allowed for grompp
