 TODO for MDPOW

- implement NVT correction

  Ghyd = Ahyd - vs^2 kappa^-1 V0^-1

- calculate V0 = <V> from average of 2nd half of equilibrium
  trajectory (probably better than volume of last frame)

- calculate volume of solute 
  - XXX: Do we need the solvent accessible volume??
  - either ``g_sas -probe 0.14 -tv`` (solvent accessible because probe
    = radius of water)
  - or
    1. remove solute from equilib frame
    2. start NPT simulation with "hole"
    3. equilibrate to new smaller box volume V'
    4. average V over 2nd half: V1 = <V'>
    5. vs = V0 - V1   (that's the best solution because it directly
       corresponds to the thermodynamics and kappa is directly
       involved via the pressure coupling... although that should not
       matter because it should only depend on the actual behaviour of
       the water e.g. what is kappa of TIP4P at the given T?)
